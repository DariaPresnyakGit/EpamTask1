Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business
You moved on, that a wrong, been a while, baby
So did I (So did I, so did I)
Took her home to your mom
Oh, but trust me that ain’t on my mind
(On my mind, on my mind, on my mind)
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I saw on my feed
She looks a little like me
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I can’t help but see
It’s not jealousy, no
Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top, and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business
Damn, I heard that you and her been having issues
I wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you
You’ll be calling me the second that it hits you
But baby, this is none of my business
